Samplicity
==============

*Samplicity* is a Python library to calculate the SAM SCR for a non-life insurer.

This Python package allows for the calculation of the SAM SCR for a non-life insurer. 
Importantly the package allows for a multiple SCR calculations to be performed simultaneously. 
This allows for the easy calcualtion of diversification benefits across various business lines, divisions, insurance classes, etc. 

The package has succesfully performed more than 60 000 SCR calculations in test environments - in matter of minutes. 
This efficiency is obtained through the use of Einstein summation in numpy. 
This prevents slow looping in Python and leverages off fast parallel matrix multiplication in numpy.
